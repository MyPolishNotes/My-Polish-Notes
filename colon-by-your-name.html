                <h2>Wszystkiego Najlepszego!</h2>
                <p>
                    <br>Happy Birthday! If you found this page without me telling you that there is an easter egg hidden on the index page, then you found it. Jk. You're awesome, or I'm just too dumb to think that it's hard to find, or both.<br><br>

                    I just want to thank you for being a good friend to me, even at times when I'm so annoying and I can feel how you hated me already lol. I admit, it is because of you that I started learning the language and began making a website. I became a so-so Polish weeb since I met you, and I'm loving Poland even though I haven't been anywhere outside my country.<br><br>
                    
                    I know that lately you have been busy, we both are, but you're much much busier XDD and I can feel it, but I just want let you know that you can reach out to me to tell your stories and dreams, good old days, you know, *teary eyes* lol. I might take this website down, especially this page, later or convert it to something else, but I'm not thinking about it yet, it might depend on how you react to me doing this, then I might delete this sooner. But anyway. <br><br>
                    
                    Just a thing about zodiacs, as you know I'm not a big fan of astrology so I don't believe that it's because I'm an aquarius and you are a scorpio that we are not vibing a lot, maybe we just don't vibe a lot for no reason XDD because my other scorpio friends vibe with me (or I just think we do hmm) but I like chatting with you, I know you're a wonderful person and a friend, that's all that matters.<br><br>
                    
                    I am writing this letter after exactly 8  months from the date we met on Omegle lol what a great place to meet someone, right XDD we ran into each other on March 11, that was evening here, and usually I like refreshing everything that happened at the time I met someone when I greet them a happy birthday, but I won't do it now because as you know we are thousands of miles apart, you know what I'm saying, I might creep you out even more, it's weird lol. But kidding aside, since that day, I still am interested in all the things you told me about, from your animes, your kind of music, to  of course the language. I am deeply grateful for those.<br><br>

                    A few things about this website. This is a kind of a draft because as you know I'm a noob here, and I don't know how to buy a domain for this, and any donation will be appreciated XDD. There are also alot of improvements to do here. So I just uploaded this to a free but safe host. About 99.8% of of what's written here is not English, but I'm getting there, give me a few years more and I can redo this all in Polish (hopefully).<br><br>
                    
                    To wrap this up, I thank you for everything that you know and not know that you have influenced me to do. This is an unusual gift to receive, but it's yours, I made it for you, because you're an amazing person, keep at it, I wish your family a good health, you stay pretty, and have a Happy Birthday, Kams.<br><br>

               <p>
                  
                    
                In our country, we destroy the neighborhood's hearing capacity by singing loud at karaokes during occasions like birthday celebrations and graduations. 
                These are some songs that I hope won't ruin your day, because I don't sing at karaokes - at the actual ones nor using phone applications like this: <br><br>

                   <p>You influenced me so much into watching anime, but I apologize because this is not a song from any anime you have watched lol and this is the one that I have been telling you about since day one, still you haven't seen it. This is Nandemonaiya by RADSWIMPS, this is one of the OSTs of Kimi no Nawa (Your Name). I provided the translations to not bother you, respectfully disregarding your Japanese skills. The message of this song just says it all, but in a more melodramatic way, that we have become so busy, but I hope everything's fine *teary eyes*.  It's from an anime after all:<br><br></p>
