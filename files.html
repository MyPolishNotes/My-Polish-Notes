            <h3>DOWNLOADABLES</h3>
            <p>Not much to see here, but if you like to see how desperate I am to learn Polish, you can download these non-suspiciously-looking virus-free files. But seriously, these are  free of corona and any other viruses.</p><br>
                <a href="Files/Polish Cases Algorithm.xlsx" download>Grammatical Cases</a><br>
                <a href="Files/Cases Practice.xlsx" download>Cases Examples</a><br><br>
                <p>These are from the great website "Mówić po polsku." I didn't reproduce this if not only for educational purposes. The big mistake that I did was to learn about the grammatical cases before broadening my vocabulary further. I have these charts pasted on my desk and on my walls just for a quick reference.</p>
<br><br>
                <a href="Files/Duolingo Polish Sentences.xlsx" download>Duolingo Polish Sentences Classified</a> <br> <br>
               <p>And these are from Duolingo. I just compiled almost all the sentences there are in the lessons, and then I classified them in their respective grammatical cases. I use this to familiarize myself on the patterns of how words change or decline depending on their use (case) in the sentence they are in. I will be updating this file as I go through all the Duolingo lessons again. I didn't reproduce this if not only for educational purposes.</p>
