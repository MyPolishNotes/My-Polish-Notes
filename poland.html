                <p>
                    <br>The Republic of Poland (Rzeczpospolita Polska) is a land-locked country located in the central Europe, and is a member of the European Union (EU) since 2004. It is in fact the 9th largest country in Europe, with 312,679 km-squared land area. It is home to 37.8 million people, a lot of fascinating things, especially the places, and of course its language.

               <h3>BRIEF HISTORY</h3>
               <p>
                   <img src="Images/history.jpg" id="locution-img1">
                If we trace back the history of Poland, we may find ourselves starting to go as far as the Iron Age. Needless to say, she has alot of history behind her, as if we can also learn almost the entire history of the world, or at least of the European continent. A Polish friend of mine asked me not once, not twice, but thrice if the Polish language sounds like Slavic to me. I said that it does, because why not, one of the earliest dwellers in its land were the Western Polans, who gave the country its name.<br><br>

                Came the 10th century AD when Poland saw its first dynasty, and the name of the famous <span class="highlightred"> Duke Mieszko I</span> arose, who adopted Christianity. Years later, his son Bolesław I the Brave transformed the country into a Medieval kingdom.<br><br>
                
                During the 14th century, Poland, ruled by the Jagiellonian dynasty, tied up with Lithuania, making the combination of them the largest country in Europe at that time, which in 1569 was constituted and called the <span class="highlightyellow">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. </span>However, the commonwealth was erased from the map in 1795. Not until 1918 that Poland and Lithuania, when the two countries are reestablished independently. <br><br>
                
                The early 19th century was not a good period for the Republic of Poland. These times were known because of the two world wars.  If you want to act smart, watch some documentaries because I won't be touching alot about it, just some turning points. It says "brief" anyway. So that was the pre-history of Poland in a nutshell.

            <h3>PEOPLE AND CULTURE</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="Images/poles.jpg" id="locution-img2">
                As what I do in this whole website, I combine empirical study with some research I made with my friend Google. What I mean by "empirical" is I've been talking to some Poles I know, don't get me wrong I've never been in Poland, or anywhere else abroad, I'm poor because of that, okay?

                <i>1. A Peak about the Language</i><br><br>
                Almost every country has a dark history behind them, and Poland is no exception. And of course, it contributes to the way the people interact with others, especially with foreigners. So according to statistics, only a few non-Polish people are currently in Poland these days, and the majority of them is made up of Europeans also, leading me to think that the Polish language is only understood by the people of Poland and those living near it.<br><br>
               
                <i>2. Foreigners in Poland </i><br><br>
                As what I think about the Polish language (that it is 'sacred' in a way), Poles are pretty conservative. Polish teenagers tell me that the elderlies are pretty conscious about foreign people in their country. Some tell me it still roots back to the great wars, and some tell me it will be after a couple of generations have passed that Poles will accept other foreign people "like normal."<br><br>

                <i>3. Some Social Matters</i><br><br>
                One fascinating (but kind of misleading) 'fact' is the maxim that when you were invited by a Pole to their home, you should take off your footwears before entering even if they say you don't need to. I guess some people are just candid, and when they say you don't have to, that means you don't really have to. But even if I know about this, I will still take my shoes off when entering their house.<br><br>

                In Poland, kissing a woman's hand is still done like normal. The males don't do this only to their acquaintances, but even to total female strangers as an introduction. It looks strange to some, but this act of gentlemen is chivalrous and sweet in reality. Everyone does this - peasants, doctors, bystanders, students, engineers, etc. - if they were gentlemen, so don't feel strange if you see them do it.<br><br>

        <h3>TRIVIAS</h3>
        <p>
           <br><img src="Images/trivias.jpg" id="locution-img1">
            For all this time that I have been learning Polish, I heard a lot of stuff, but I still have to validate them. So here are some of the most interesting facts I have gathered:<br><br>

            <i>1. Special Middlenames.</i> <br><br> Studying Poland made me realize how much differences there are between the East and the West, which also means I'm an ignorant. So. I was talking to some Poles now and then, the first one of them told me that a Pole's middlename is acquired after a ceremony (called the "bierzmowanie") or confirmation done in a church. As I was doing my research, people are also fascinated that only a few Poles have middlenames (because of religion). However, most of them have two given names like "Natalia Weronika," followed immediately by their surname (eg. Natalia Weronika Duda). In addition, Poland celebrates a Name Day ("imieniny" in Polish).<br><br>

            <i> 2. Earthquakes. </i><br><br>Earthquakes rarely occur in Poland. Many of the Poles I have talked to said they haven't experienced any. I used to believe that Poland does not experience this natural phenomenon. However, it is just rare in their country really (but not rarer than that of Qatar's). Poland is a country with low seismic activities. The latest one, a 4.9 magnitude earthquake in Polkowice, has been recorded. This did not cause any structural damage, although it is one of the strongest eartquakes they have in their entire history.<br><br>

            <i>3. A Thing about Potatoes. </i><br><br>Potatoes are pretty popular in Poland. I mean, I like potatoes to (if they are fried or mashed), but Poles have another thing for them.Potato recipes always have a place in every Polish household meals. Everybody keeps telling me that if I want to marry a Pole, I should learn how to eat more potatoes (which is undoubtedly a pleasure for me). An article about the Polish word "kartofel" says it originates from the German word "Kartoffel," but more originally from the Italian word "tartufo" which means "truffle." Not to mention that if you type in "kartofel" to Google Translate, it will tell you it's a Bulgarian word.<br><br>

            <i>4. Blue and Green Eyes. </i><br><br>Green is considered to be the rarest eye color in the world, well, the same is quite true in Poland, too. But in fact, all my friends from Poland have green eyes, both men and women ( needless to say I didn't select them but just a mere coincidence). In a study conducted by Pośpiech et al. (2016), of the 999 Poles (579 females, 420 males), 14.2% of the women have green eyes, close to the 15.4% who have brown eyes. More common are the hazel and blue color, the latter being the most common. It might not seem interesting to some, but the world's most common eye color is brown (which is just the second most common in Poland) and blue as the second rarest (which is most common in Poland). I provided the statistics, I will leave the genetic science to you, okay?<br><br>

            <i>5. Daylight-Saving Time. </i><br><br>Again, this might not strike interest to anyone living in countries with these time shifts. But in Poland, as well as in most areas in Europe and North America, their clocks go forward 1 hour every 2 am on March 29, and back 1 hour at 3 am on October 25. So people in those areas literally adjust their clock to go forward by 1 hour (called the Central European Time or CET) at March 29, and then 1 hour back on October 25 (called the Daylight Saving Time or DST). Some say this is stupid, some just don't care. <br><br>
