                <p>
                    <br>Places in Poland are not good. They are the best. Not to mention the 16 UNESCO recognized world heritage sites it has to date. 15 of which are cultural sites (one of them being featured in this page) and 1 natural site which is a forest. Unfortunately I find another forest in Poland which I find just a little bit more interesting. But overall, all these world heritage sites are, of course, of world-class beauty.

               <h3>WARSAW</h3>
               <p>
                   <img src="Images/warsaw.jpg" id="locution-img1">
                Aside from being Poland's capital city, Warsaw is home to alot of history of the country (probably the reason why it is the capital). All the vlogs that I watched regarding these places, especially Warsaw, made me feel like I've been there before, which kind of ironically makes me more interested to moving there (yes, not just visiting, after some seven years or so).<br>
                <br>
                Shown in the left is the Old Town in Warsaw. This looks like a modern style painting but this is just Warsaw at night, and is another reason why it is in the top of my list. The aesthetics of the place cannot be ignored.<span id="sniezka"></span>

            <h3>ŚNIEŻKA</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="Images/sniezka.jpg" id="locution-img2">From the cities, here we have the most famous mountain (at least for me) located at the Southwest of Poland. Śnieżka Mountain is over 1,600 meters (5,260 ft. from the ground). What fascinates me is that it is also located at the border of Poland and Czech Republic.
                <br>
               <br>
               At the peak of the mountain is the Śnieżka Meteorological Observatory which was constructed between the 1960s and 70s. It was originally built to replace the old observatory which was badly damaged by terrible weather conditions and could not handle the large number of tourists. I personally do not believe that UFOs exist, but I will take a good second look at it again as the building of the Śnieżka Observatory was also inspired by a UFO theory, symbolized by the three disks on this building.

        <h3>ZAMOŚĆ</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/zamosc.jpg" id="locution-img1">Believe me, I also love my country of origin, but when speaking of perfection, Zamość is the place that always comes to my mind. History has it that Bernardo Morando and Jan Zamoyski built Zamość, designed by the former from the late 1570s until 1600.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Old City of Zamość was also one of the earliest UNESCO World Heritage sites to be recognized in Poland. It is said that the city was built to provide all the needs of the citizens (foreign and local alike, as Italian people were also here because of Morando). It was like an enclosed city with everything in it: scientific labs, a market square, a Jewish-German school, etc. and a beautiful view of the brilliant architectures there are. The barriers that were put to defend against conquerors at that time were carefully restored.

        <h3>THE FOREST</h3><span id="the-forest"></span>
        <br>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/forest.jpg" id="locution-img2">As I was watching some creepy stuff in the internet (like cold cases of disappearances of people), I saw a video thumbnail of these fascinating trees, but at that time, I didn't know it's located in Poland.<br>
                <br>
            There are lots of theories surrounding this phenomena, but the soundest one I have known of is that these trees were 'trained'. A bit less but also maybe correct one is that the strong winds in that place caused these trees to appear like they do. 
            <br>
            <br>The Crooked Forest is located in the western Poland. It has approximately 400 trees bent 90 degrees. Oddly enough, this forest is kind of a subset of a larger forest surrounding it with all the trees grown normally.
            <br><br>
            In what I call the 'Snow Theory,' a heavy snowy period once covered only this particular area for a along time, causing the trees to bend. I almost believed it, but on second thought, that 'trained theory above' is more scientific to me. So going back to that, it says that these bended trees were planted during the 1930s and 'trained' be grow like that to suit the people's construction needs, like a big chair in that exact shape, or a wooden roof curved just like that.

        <h3>KRAKÓW</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/krakow.jpg" id="locution-img1">The last but arguably not the least in my list (I like these homophones) is Kraków. To be honest, I don't really know what to put in the last place, but Kraków is like the must-visit-before-anywhere-else-and-before-going-back-home sort of place in Poland.
            
            <br><br>The first two UNESCO World Heritage sites recognized in 1978 were the Wieliczka Salt Mine and the Historic Center of Kraków. The city of Kraków also boasts the largest medieval square in the entire Europe, which is the Main Market Square, and on this square is where 'The Head' lies. I will just be giving the links to keep this list short. 'The Head' is a huge sculpture, given the title of "Eros Bendato."<span id="krakow"></span>

            <br><br>Above all the beautiful things in Kraków is its centerpiece (St. Mary's Basilica), where the 'hejnal' is played from its window, by a 'bugler.' There is a myth related to this which is the most important thing to know, but I will just be directing you to go to <a href="#">this link</a> instead.
